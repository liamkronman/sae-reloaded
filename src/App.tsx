Our members come from West Virginia to California, study everything from Math to Music, but find commonality in the idea that MIT is better when you’re part of a family. Ask any brother why they chose SAE, and they will likely tell you it’s because we’re “The Boys,” but beyond that, it’s because of our commitment to a supportive and inclusive environment that has served hundreds of brothers before us. Located at 155 Bay State Rd, SAE enjoys a prime location along the banks of the Charles, along with a short 10 minute bike commute to campus. If you want to join a community that has fun, works hard, and finds comfort in brotherhood, then be sure to come check us out!" />
